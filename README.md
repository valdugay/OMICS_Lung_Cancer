# README : Bias Discovery 

## Folder & File Descriptions

### `rna/`
Contains 601 `.tsv` files, each representing the RNA sequence data for a single cell sample.

### `clinical/`
- `clinical.tsv`: Contains all patient-related information, including clinical data and demographics.
- `exposure.tsv`: Describes exposure-related data for each patient (e.g. smoking history, environmental exposure, etc).

### `biospecimen.cart.2024-10-08/`
Folder generated by downloading biospecimen-related data from [GDC Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). Includes files such as `aliquot.tsv`, `analyte.tsv`, `portion.tsv`, `sample.tsv`, and `slide.tsv`, which contain technical details about sample processing.

### `build_rna_dataset.py`
Python script to build a unified RNA dataset by parsing all files from the `rna/` folder.

### `sample_sheet.tsv`
Links RNA sequence IDs to TCGA metadata, including project name, sample ID, patient ID, and—most importantly—the sample type (Tumor or Normal tissue).

### `metadata.json`
Describes the structure and contents of the `rna/` folder.

### `Notebook.ipynb`
Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis pipeline: dataset preparation, bias detection, feature selection, and other exploratory work.
