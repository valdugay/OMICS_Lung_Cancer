# README : Bias Discovery 

## Folder & File Descriptions

### `rna/`
Contains 601 `.tsv` files, each representing the RNA sequence data for a single cell sample.

### `clinical/`
- `clinical.tsv`: Contains all patient-related information, including clinical data and demographics.
- `exposure.tsv`: Describes exposure-related data for each patient (e.g. smoking history, environmental exposure, etc).

### `biospecimen.cart.2024-10-08/`
Folder generated by downloading biospecimen-related data from [GDC Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). Includes files such as `aliquot.tsv`, `analyte.tsv`, `portion.tsv`, `sample.tsv`, and `slide.tsv`, which contain technical details about sample processing.

### `build_rna_dataset.py`
Python script to build a unified RNA dataset by parsing all files from the `rna/` folder.

### `sample_sheet.tsv`
Links RNA sequence IDs to TCGA metadata, including project name, sample ID, patient ID, and—most importantly—the sample type (Tumor or Normal tissue).

### `metadata.json`
Describes the structure and contents of the `rna/` folder.

### `Notebook.ipynb`
Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis pipeline: dataset preparation, bias detection, feature selection, and other exploratory work.

### `Notebook.ipynb`
- **Main analysis notebook** showcasing data loading, bias discovery, feature engineering, and machine learning steps.  
- **Key sections** typically include:

  1. **Data Ingestion**
     - Demonstrates how `.tsv` files from `rna/`, patient metadata (`sample_sheet.tsv`), and clinical files (`clinical.tsv`, `exposure.tsv`) are merged.
     - Provides code cells for quick checks of missing data or file mismatches.

  2.  **Bias Discovery**
     - Analyzes potential imbalances in the dataset (e.g., how many Tumor vs Normal samples, how many missing demographic entries).
     - Visualizations to understand main biases like unbalanced class, unbalanced ethnical patients, extremy high-dimensional data, ...

  3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
     - Handles missing values, normalizes, clips outliers, ...

  4. **Feature Selection**
     - Apply Mutual Information (MI Score) to select more relavant features and reduce dimensionality.

  5. **Machine Learning Pipeline**
     - Trains models (e.g. Logistic Regression) to predict tumor vs. normal or other clinical outcomes.
     - Documents hyperparameters, cross-validation splits, and scoring metrics.

  6. **Model Evaluation & Bias Checks**
     - Presents performance metrics (accuracy, AUC) plus confusion matrices or classification reports.
     - Discusses any remaining bias or imbalance issues — for instance, does the model over-predict Tumor?
     - Testing feature importance to check reliability of the model.
